Pay close attention to the layout and text to accurately identify fields.\n\n1.  **Type Identification:** The card type is almost always \"Dissertation or thesis\". Only classify it differently if there's strong evidence to the contrary. S. alone means it is definitely a dissertation.\n2.  **Author Extraction:** Extract the author's last and first names. Pay attention to diacritics and special characters; \"Zust\" should be corrected to \"Züst\".\n3.  **Title Extraction:** Extract the full title of the publication.\n4.  **Publication Details:** Extract the year and place of publication. If a publisher is explicitly mentioned (e.g., \"Med.Fak.Ludwig-Maximilian-Univ.\"), include it; otherwise, leave it as null. Infer the place if it is available from other fields (e.g., the shelfmark).\n5.  **Physical Description:** Extract the number of pages and format (e.g., \"8'\", \"8°\").\n6.  **Library Reference:** Extract the shelfmark and any subject headings. If subjects are present, separate them by \"/\".\n7.  **Shelfmark Details:** Prioritize information included in the shelfmark field if it provides missing information on place or publisher.\n8. **Format:** Be careful to extract all elements present in the shelfmark.",
